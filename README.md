# Finance-Project for Beginners
This project analyzes the stocks of different companies such as Bank Of America, JPM, Citi etc. for the time period of 2006-2016. It makes use of basic libraries such
as Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy etc. I have collated data of 6 different stocks and performed basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on them.
The data was collected using the well-known open-source Yahoo Finance API yfinance available under the PyPi.
